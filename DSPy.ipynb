To begin your study of the life of Muad\\'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad\\'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.\\n-from \"Manual of Muad\\'Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\\n\\nIn the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.\\nIt was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.\\nThe old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul\\'s room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.\\nBy the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow -- hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded \\'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.\\n\"Is he not small for his age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.\\nPaul\\'s mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\" \\n\"So I\\'ve heard, so I\\'ve heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he\\'s already fifteen.\" \\n\"Yes, Your Reverence.\"\\n\"He\\'s awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he\\'s really the Kwisatz Haderach'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'split': 4}, page_content=' You\\'ll ride upon your own two feet without \\'thopter or groundcar or mount.\"\\nAnd Paul had been caught more by her tone -- singsong and wavering -- than by her words.\\n\"When you live upon Arrakis,\" she had said, \"khala, the land is empty. The moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.\" \\nPaul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: \"Do you see no hope. Your Reverence?\"\\n\"Not for the father.\" And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence, looked down at Paul. \"Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things . . . \" She held up four big-knuckled fingers. \". . . the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing . . . \" She closed her fingers into a fist. \". . . without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!\"\\nA week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat\\'s puzzled frown.\\n\"Where were you woolgathering that time?\" Hawat asked.\\n\"Did you meet the Reverend Mother?\"\\n\"That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?\" Hawat\\'s eyes quickened with interest. \"I met her.\"\\n\"She . . . \" Paul hesitated, found that he couldn\\'t tell Hawat about the ordeal. The inhibitions went deep. \\n\"Yes? What did she?\"\\nPaul took two deep breaths. \"She said a thing.\" He closed his eyes, calling up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old woman\\'s tone: \" \\'You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you must learn to rule. It\\'s something none of your ancestors learned.\\' \" Paul opened his eyes, said: \"That made me angry and I said my father rules an entire planet. And she said, \\'He\\'s losing it.\\' And I said my father was getting a richer planet.'),\n",

He felt excitement that his father would be coming. They had spent so little time together since the Emperor\\'s command to take over the fief of Arrakis.\\nYueh crossed to the ell table, thinking: How the boy has filled out these past few months. Such a waste! Oh, such a sad waste. And he reminded himself: I must not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no longer can be hurt by the Harkonnen beasts.\\nPaul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. \"What\\'ll I be studying on the way across?\"\\n\"Ah-h-h-h, the terranic life forms of Arrakis.

It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound -- the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. \\nThe dream faded.\\nPaul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed -- thinking . . . thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o\\'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. \\nArrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.\\nPaul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him.
