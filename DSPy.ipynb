CHOAM was the key to wealth, each noble House dipping from the company's coffers whatever it could under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships -- they were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his supporters.\n","\"The Duke Leto,\" Piter said, \"may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum along the desert's edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined security. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty's agents -- the planetary ecologist.

Your uncle will have dispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis.\" \n","\"More profits,\" Feyd-Rautha said.\n","\"Indeed,\" the Baron said. And he thought: It's only just.

It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound -- the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. \n","The dream faded.\n","Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed -- thinking . . . thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. \n","Arrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.\n","Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness . . . focusing the consciousness . . . aortal dilation . . . avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness . . . to be conscious by choice . . . blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions . . . one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone . . . animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct . . . the animal destroys and does not produce . . . animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual . . . the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe . . . focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid . . . bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs . . . all things/cells/beings are impermanent . . . strive for flow-permanence within . . . \n","Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled.\n","When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids»\n","[3] «is . . .except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the desert . . . and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as the native labor pool.\n","\"And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the Atreides,\" Piter said. \"They will know.\" \n","\"They will know,\" the Baron breathed.\n","\"Loveliest of all,\" Piter said, \"is that the Duke will know, too.

As he emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension -- grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.\n","\"I am hungry,\" the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. \"Send for food, my darling. We will eat before we retire.\"»\n","\n","Question: Which of the following is not one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad?\n","\n","Choices: - A. The Acheans - B. The Atreides - C. The Corrinos - D.

Please hurry.\"\n","\n","The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a tapestried chair watching mother and son approach. Windows on each side of her overlooked the curving southern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the Atreides family holding, but the Reverend Mother ignored the view. She was feeling her age this morning, more than a little petulant. She blamed it on space travel and association with that abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive ways. But here was a mission that required personal attention from a Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight. Even the Padishah Emperor's Truthsayer couldn't evade that responsibility when the duty call came.\n","Damn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thought. If only she 'd borne us a girl as she was ordered to do!\n","Jessica stopped three paces from the chair, dropped a small curtsy, a gentle flick of left hand along the line of her skirt. Paul gave the short bow his dancing master had taught -- the one used \"when in doubt of another's station.\"\n","The nuances of Paul's greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She said: \"He's a cautious one, Jessica.\" \n","Jessica's hand went to Paul's shoulder, tightened there. For a heartbeat, fear pulsed through her palm. Then she had herself under control. \"Thus he has been taught, Your Reverence.\" \n","What does she fear? Paul wondered.\n","The old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker: face oval like Jessica's, but strong bones . . . hair: the Duke's black-black but with browline of the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin, disdainful nose; shape of directly staring green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal grandfather who is dead.\n","Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura -- even in death, the Reverend Mother thought.\n","\"Teaching is one thing,\" she said, \"the basic ingredient is another. We shall see.\" The old eyes darted a hard glance at Jessica. \"Leave us. I enjoin you to practice the meditation of peace.\"\n","Jessica took her hand from Paul's shoulder. \"Your Reverence, I --\" \n","\"Jessica, you know it must be done»\n","[2] « stand in your place and take your sufferings. But each of us must make her own path.\" \n","\"I know.\"\n","\"You're as dear to me as any of my own daughters, but I cannot let that interfere with duty.\" \n","\"I understand . . . the necessity.\"\n","\"What you did, Jessica, and why you did it -- we both know. But kindness forces me to tell you there's little chance your lad will be the Bene Gesserit Totality. You mustn't let yourself hope too much.\"\n","Jessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes. It was an angry gesture. \"You make me feel like a little girl again -- reciting my first lesson.\" She forced the words out: \" 'Humans must never submit to animals.' \" A dry sob shook her. In a low voice, she said: \"I've been so lonely.\"\n","\"It should be one of the tests,\" the old woman said. \"Humans are almost always lonely. Now summon the boy. He's had a long, frightening day. But he's had time to think and remember, and I must ask the other questions about these dreams of his.\" \n","Jessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it. \"Paul, come in now, please.\"\n","Paul emerged with a stubborn slowness.

It\\'s a dangerous advantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen greater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium.\"\\n\"You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"Not in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we\\'ll have an irrevocable directorship in the CHOAM Company.\" \\nFeyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to wealth, each noble House dipping from the company\\'s coffers whatever it could under the power of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships -- they were the real evidence of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his supporters.\\n\"The Duke Leto,\" Piter said, \"may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum along the desert\\'s edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined security. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty\\'s agents -- the planetary ecologist. You may remember him -- Kynes.\" \\n\"Feyd remembers him,\" the Baron said. \"Get on with it.\" \\n\"You do not drool very prettily, Baron,\" Piter said. \\n\"Get on with it, I command you!\" the Baron roared.\\nPiter shrugged. \"If matters go as planned,\" he said, \"House Harkonnen will have a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have dispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis.\" \\n\"More profits,\" Feyd-Rautha said.\\n\"Indeed,\" the Baron said. And he thought: It\\'s only just. We\\'re the ones who tamed Arrakis . . .except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the desert . . . and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as the native labor pool.\\n\"And the Great Houses will know that the»\\n[2] « Great Houses of the Landsraad.\\n\"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said.\\nArrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.\\nPaul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound -- the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions. \\nThe dream faded.\\nPaul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed -- thinking . . . thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o\\'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate. \\nArrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.\\nPaul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness . . . focusing the consciousness . . . aortal dilation . . . avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness . . . to be conscious by choice . . . blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions . . . one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone . . . animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct . . . the animal destroys and does not produce . . . animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual . . . the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe . . . focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid . . . bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs . . . all things/cells/beings are impermanent . . . strive for flow-permanence within . . . \\nOver and over and over within Paul\\'s floating awareness the lesson rolled.\\nWhen dawn touched Paul\\'s window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids»\\n[3] «is . . .except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the desert . . . and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as the native labor pool.\\n\"And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the Atreides,\" Piter said. \"They will know.\" \\n\"They will know,\" the Baron breathed.\\n\"Loveliest of all,\" Piter said, \"is that the Duke will know, too. He knows now. He can already feel the trap.\"\\n\"It\\'s true the Duke knows,\" the Baron said, and his voice held a note of sadness. \"He could not help but know . . . more\\'s the pity.\"\\nThe Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. As he emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension -- grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them.\\n\"I am hungry,\" the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. \"Send for food, my darling.
